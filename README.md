## Privacy Concerns

1. **Data Protection**

   - No user images are stored permanently
   - API keys are handled securely

2. **User Privacy**
   - No personal information is collected
   - No tracking or analytics implemented
   - No cookies used for tracking

3. **API Usage**
   - Uses Google's Gemini API with proper authentication
   - All API calls are made server-side for security
   - Rate limiting implemented to prevent abuse

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
